# webzero-content-bank

This content is WIP. The goal of this repository is to become a place for curating content that the Polkadot community can either use directly as is, or as a source of truth for creating their own workshops and talks. Its goal is also to be where experts on certain topics review the content that is published so that there the source of truth is always up to date and accurate.

LICENSE TBD.
