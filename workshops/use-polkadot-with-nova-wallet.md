## Workshop overview

![nova-wallet-qr-code](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByODFtt3a.png)

1. ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Nova wallet on your phones
1. ‚úçÔ∏è Create a wallet, save your seed phrases securely
1. üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Raise your hands and I'll send you some KSM

Note: 
**Why KSM?**: in order to use features that aren't available on other chains, experimental network.
**‚ö†Ô∏èAbout saving your seed phrase:** Th, so it is reasonable to save it in a way that is not "Best practice". Security is contextual, and given that this is just for practice, it is ok for you to save your seed phrase into a password manager. Please don't just leave it on your desktop. That is sloppy. When you are ready to start making serious transactions and meaningly practicipate in governance processes, please set yourself up with a properly secured seed phrase. This is important for protecting your access and a cruicial part of responsible community participation. 

While everyone sends me their addresses, go over things to note about Nova wallet and its key features. Show block explorer or Polkadot JS apps to see on-chain activity.
