## Appchain development: start hacking 👷

Tip: start with customizing your pallets in a standalone node template

- [Basic Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template): a basic Substrate node, with minimal functionality and a template pallet perfect to start hacking with

Note: for anything appchain development, you're using Substrate and FRAME libraries. More on this in the next part of the workshop.
