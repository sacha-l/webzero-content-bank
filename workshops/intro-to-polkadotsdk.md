# Intro to Polkadot SDK

â€‹Dive into the Polkadot SDK to learn the basics about building a Substrate based appchain.
You'll write simple FRAME pallets and learn about the different components of the Polkadot SDK by completing a fun quest as you progress through the workshop.

---

## Agenda

- Polkadot SDK repo
- Key topics: pallets, frame features

---

Things to note: 
- the mono repo is ___ in size  ! cloning it will take a while.. 
- the mono repo is made up of substrate, polkaodt and cumulus

```bash
 git clone -b polkadot-v1.1.0 --single-branch https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git
 ```
 ---

## Releases

Throughout the workshop we'll use the `polkadot-v1.1.0`.

It's important to always make sure you're using the same releases throughout your projects: FRAME pallets, parachain templates etc. Otherwise you'll run into compatibility issues.

---

## What is the SDK?

- libraries to build standalone blockchains
- libraries to make your blockchain polkadot compatible
- libraries specific to the polkadot protocol

---

## Workshop learning goals

---

## How workshop quests work
- We learn something, some concept
- Presenter demonstrates going through each step to understand the concept
- A mini quest is presented, audience members who complete it successfully submit solution (raise hand, enter bytes in smart contract etc)

## What we're going to actually do
